# EvaluateTestFrameworks

## Overview

This solution demonstrates comprehensive testing strategies in .NET 9 using multiple frameworks and approaches. It includes projects for MSTest, xUnit, NUnit, and SpecFlow, as well as a shared code library. The solution is designed for modern .NET development and leverages the latest features and best practices.

## Projects

### 1. CodeLibrary
- **Purpose:** Contains core business logic and shared code used by all test projects.
- **Target Framework:** .NET 9

### 2. MSTestFramework
- **Purpose:** Implements unit tests using the MSTest framework.
- **Features:** Standard unit testing, code coverage analysis.
- **Target Framework:** .NET 9

### 3. XUnitFramework
- **Purpose:** Implements unit tests using the xUnit framework.
- **Features:** Supports Selenium WebDriver for UI testing.
- **Target Framework:** .NET 9

### 4. NUnitFramework
- **Purpose:** Implements unit tests using the NUnit framework.
- **Target Framework:** .NET 9

### 5. SpecFlowFramework

## Unit Testing Approach

- **Pattern:** Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA)
- **Execution:** Use Visual Studio's __Test Explorer__ to run and manage tests.
- **Code Coverage:** Analyze via __Test > Analyze Code Coverage for All Tests__.

## Known Issues

- SpecFlow tests run in Test Explorer but are skipped during code coverage analysis.
